--Canadian Liquified Natural Gas Imports and Exports 2009 to Present (April 2023)

/*
Notes
1 - There are three Excel Worksheets (English, see Canada.ca - Open Government - Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) â€“ Imports and Exports
for French datasets). The three worksheets are DETAIL (all imports and exports), Monthly and Annual (the last two
provide sums of imports and exports with less detail). Monthly and Annual are used to check our calculations.

2 - MC3 (Mm3) is the measuremeant used in Canada and Europe, while MCF is for American measurement.

3 - A common mistake appears if using Monthy and Annual reports for totals, because 
they show double the total volume compared to "DETAIL" file. 
This is because they have feature "total" rows after each month or year, doubling the results, that need to be 
removed from queries to avoid misrepresenting the values. 

4 - A quick note to avoid confusion. Total Volume Import and Export has roughly a 3:1 ratio since 2009. Natural gas (not liquified)
imports and exports have a ratio of rouhgly 1:3. This is purely coincidence, but important to know, because it would
be easy to assume that the dataset is mislabelled to a reader who only has knowledge of natural gas and not liquified Natural gas.
