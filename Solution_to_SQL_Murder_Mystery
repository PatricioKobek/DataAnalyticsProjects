The [SQL Murder Mystery]( https://mystery.knightlab.com/) is a great activity to do after learning a bit of the basics. Following the steps below will help reveal the killer and solve the case!

/*
Notes: The interface of the website does not let you store SQL code as you work along. I recommend proceeding in a manner similar to is below, storing your code and query results within “/**/” notes, because you will need to reference material often. This is especially true when you go to JOIN tables, which makes solving the case far easier.

Solution:
/*Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. 
The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". 
The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".*/

/*SELECT * FROM person WHERE name LIKE "%Annabel%" AND address_street_name = "Franklin Ave";
16371	Annabel Miller	490173	103	Franklin Ave	318771143 */

/*SELECT MAX(address_number) FROM person WHERE address_street_name = "Northwestern Dr";
Address is 4919*/

/*SELECT * FROM person WHERE address_number = "4919";
id = 14887	name = Morty Schapiro	license_id 118009	
address_number = 4919	address_street_name = Northwestern Dr ssn = 111564949 */

/*Interview has person_id which is equal to table.person id*/

/*SELECT * FROM interview WHERE person_id = "14887" and "16371";
Morty Schapiro states:
I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. 
The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". 
Only gold members have those bags. 
The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".

Annabel Miller states:
I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was 
working out last week on January the 9th.
*/

/*SELECT * FROM get_fit_now_member where membership_status = "gold" AND id LIKE "48Z%";
Two results: 
id		person_id  name			membership_start_date	membership_status
48Z7A	28819	Joe Germuska	20160305	gold
48Z55	67318	Jeremy Bowers	20160101	gold  */

/*SELECT * FROM drivers_license WHERE plate_number like "%H42W%" AND gender = "male";
Two results:
id	age	height	eye_color	hair_color	gender	plate_number	car_make	car_model
423327	30	70	brown	brown	male	0H42W2	Chevrolet	Spark LS
664760	21	71	black	black	male	4H42WR	Nissan	Altima  */

/*SELECT * FROM get_fit_now_check_in WHERE membership_id = "48Z7A" 
AND check_in_date = "20180109" OR membership_id = "48Z55" 
AND check_in_date = "20180109";
Result is both men were at the gym at different times.
membership_id	check_in_date	check_in_time	check_out_time
48Z7A	20180109	1600	1730
48Z55	20180109	1530	1700 

Next: What time was Annabel Miller working out?

/*SELECT * FROM get_fit_now_member WHERE name = "Annabel Miller";
id	person_id	name	membership_start_date	membership_status

/*SELECT * FROM get_fit_now_check_in WHERE membership_id = "90081" 
AND check_in_date = "20180109";
membership_id	check_in_date	check_in_time	check_out_time
90081	20180109	1600	1700
Result - Both men are working out when she is present.

Not sure if useful at all, this is Jeremy Bowers, but Annabel Miller also checked
into this event on the same day, but Joe Germuska did not.

First Joe Germuska, then Miranda Priestly as the woman who hired him as a hitman. 

Congrats! You’ve solved the case!
