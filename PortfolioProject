SQL Queries for Covid-19 Deaths Worldwide data (Data cleaning, validation, Tableau dashboard project)
This begins as a guided project but there are several key changes in the code for a more unique analysis.  

Important notes - Author of original guided project does not format their data in a way that works
with calculations. Most queries require [AS FLOAT] or similar for calculations.

Second, the original author does not clean the data set (location, continent, income) which will result in significant errors (literally 
5x as many cases worldwide). After downloading the data (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths as of April 11, 2023), ensure to check and clean these specific
columns.

/*
Regarding my second point above, Total Cases calculates to 3,232,470,197, which is incorrect and five times a much as the actual worldwide infection rate.
See the [NOT IN] list in the query below for an example of column categories that need to be excluded 
from the calculation or cleaned in the source data.
