/*
Covid-19 Analysis of Worldwide rates of infection, fatal cases, vaccination by region (Data cleaning, validation, Tableau dashboard project)
This begins as a guided project but there are several key changes for a unique analysis.  

Important notes - Author of original guided project does not format the initial data. If following 
that same guide, queries require [AS FLOAT] or similar for all calculations.

Second, the downloaded data set (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths as of April 11, 2023) requires cleaning (coumns location, continent, income). 
Using the data in its default format will result in significant errors, such as calculating the worldwide infection rate at more than five times
the actual number.

/*
Regarding my second point above, using the raw, uncleaned data shows "Total Cases" as 3,232,470,197, which is incorrect and five times a much as the actual 
worldwide infection rate. See the [NOT IN] list in the query below for an example of column categories that need to be excluded from the calculation or 
cleaned in the source data.
